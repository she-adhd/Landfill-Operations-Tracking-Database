# Landfill-Operations-Tracking-Database
Keeps track of 50 – 75 field employees’ daily productivity. In the database we track each employee, their destinations, amount of loads,  the asset/equipment they use, its odometer/hours (beginning, end, &amp; total), daily inspection checks for each equipment used, and other task and equipment details. For each task we are able to pull reports, and with our user-friendly interface, other supervisors are able to insert their own criteria to create a report they need.
